== Description ==
Introducing the Simple Affiliate Marketing Disclosure Plugin. This plugin will insert your Affiliate Disclosure on every blog post you have published on your blog, and the ones you create in the future automatically. 

One of the best parts about this plugin is the disclosure does not affect the view of the post preview snippet within your pages. We were able to do this with very lean code as well, so it will not impact your web page performance including the loading speed. Yep, that means it\'s SEO friendly!
